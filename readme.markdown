Open with Chrome
================

This is a service for Mac OS X to quickly open your current Safari tab in Google Chrome.

When possible, I prefer not to install Flash player on my computer. Every now and then, something will be missing because of that. Fortunately Chrome comes with a version of Flash player baked in, so I use that as a fallback when needed.

Setup
-----

Open Automator and create a new service. This does not require any input so set that to "no input" in "Safari".

Grab a "Run AppleScript" block and paste this in.

Save and off you go.
